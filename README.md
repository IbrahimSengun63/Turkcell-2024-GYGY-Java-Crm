# üü° Turkcell Crm Project - GYGY 3.0 - ƒ∞brahim ≈üeng√ºn


This project was carried out within the scope of Turkcell Youth Investment Software for the Future 3.0 Java programme. With the 120-hour course, it was decided to do the project in groups. I took part in the development process of CustomerService from start to finish in the group I was in. 

We carried out our work by creating a common organisation on GitHub. At the same time, we used it as a configuration server by creating a repository in our common github organisation. You can access the project's configuration server from  [this link](https://github.com/IbrahimSengun63/Turkcell-2024-GYGY-Java-Crm-Configurations) in my repository. In addition, we used it effectively by creating a common page on Figma to analyse the project and determine the requirements and follow the development. Each group member was responsible for the service/server that fell on him.



## Hi, I'm ƒ∞brahim! üëã I have a little more information for you:

In this project I was involved in the development of the Micro service setup and configurations with docker and without docker(local) from start to finish. Here are the main topics I covered during the development process:
- Creation of microservices
- Git branch strategy and settings for the group project within the organization
- Docker settings and network configurations for Docker Compose
- Microservice separations and folder structures
- Microservices POM XML configurations for both local build and Docker build
- Container and image setup and configurations for Docker
- Configuring the database with code-first using JPA Hibernate
- Establishment of DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- Config server setup
- Eureka configurations and setup
- Auth server security and user development
- Base server for security and package management
- Creation of managers and implementation of services
- Creation of controllers
- Performing validations
- Creation of business rules
- Ensuring global exception handling
- Testing via Docker
üöÄ I am happy to have completed the auth server, base server (core), and microservices setup and configurations development after a very instructive and developing process. It has been a very useful experience for me. I spent productive time both analyzing and coding the project, as well as during the testing phase.

üôè At the end of the day, I would like to thank Turkcell and all those who contributed to this process. My Linkedin address if you want to take a look:
